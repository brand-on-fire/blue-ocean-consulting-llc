They say the only two things you can count on in life are death and taxes. But there are ways to minimize your tax burden when it comes to your investments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Let&#8217;s look at the various taxes that target investments:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Capital Gains. <\/strong>Anytime you sell an investment and realize a profit, you&#8217;re usually going to be taxed.<strong><em> If you sell within 12 months of acquiring that investment, the gains are taxed as income.<\/em><\/strong> This could be as much as 35%, depending on your income.<ol><li><strong><em>If the investment is held for more than a year before being sold, the capital gains tax applies, which is 15% for most taxpayers.<\/em><\/strong> It can be as low as 0% if you\u2019re in the 10% or 15% tax bracket for ordinary income. Capital gains tax can be as high as 20% for those above specified income levels. (There is also a 3.8% Net Investment tax that is frequently not considered)<\/li><li>Capital gains also apply to some mutual fund distributions. This can happen even if you don&#8217;t sell your shares. When your mutual fund company sells stocks it owns, those taxable gains are passed along.<\/li><li>Other types of investments have different tax structures. <strong><em>Profits from selling a primary residence are not taxed, up to $250,000 in profits ($500,000 for married couples).<\/em><\/strong> Futures contracts are complicated. Some of the profits are taxed as long-term investments, regardless of how long they were held.<\/li><\/ol><\/li><li><strong>Dividends and other income. <\/strong>Not only are you taxed for selling your investments, but you also have to pay taxes on dividend and interest income. Rental income is also taxed, but at your regular tax rate. Usually, dividends are taxed at 15%. <ol><li><strong><em>Interest on bonds and most other investment income gets taxed at your income tax rate.<\/em><\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Municipal Bonds. <\/strong>This interest is tax-free for federal taxes and can be tax-free at the state-level, too. Be aware that municipal bonds and their taxation can be complicated, so be sure to consult your tax professional on the details that apply in your situation.<\/li><\/ol><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Strategies<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Make great investments and don&#8217;t sell. <\/strong>Warren Buffett has relatively few investments and he rarely sells anything. <strong><em>Consider that every time you sell a stock and make money, those earnings are going to be taxed.<\/em><\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>If you&#8217;re making good investments, you should be able to hold on to them for a long period of time. This is another reason to invest with a long-term perspective.<\/li><li><strong>Use your retirement accounts as much as possible.<\/strong><\/li><li>Traditional IRAs offer the opportunity to invest pre-tax money. In other words, the money that you invest was not subjected to income taxes. However, there are taxes to be paid when you start taking the money back out.<\/li><li>A 401(k) offers advantages similar to a traditional IRA, namely pre-tax contributions. The money is also taxed when contributions are taken.<\/li><li><strong><em>Roth IRA: the money invested is after tax, but all the gains are not taxed \u2013 even when you take the money out in retirement!<\/em><\/strong> There are rules to be followed regarding when you can start taking the money out without incurring penalties. But the benefit of avoiding taxes on gains is huge!<\/li><li><strong>Health Savings Accounts. <\/strong>These are, in essence, tax-free investment accounts for your health. Any money you put in the account is pre-tax and must be used for medical expenses.<ul><li>These accounts permit setting aside up to $3,250 per year for an individual or $6,450 for a family. The money can be pre-tax in most cases, and the balance of the account can be rolled over each year.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>If you have a flexible spending account with your employer, you can&#8217;t also have a health savings account. You must choose one over the other.<\/li><li><strong>529 Plans. <\/strong>These are investment accounts for expenses related to higher education. <ul><li>Contributions aren\u2019t tax deductible, but the earnings grow tax-deferred. The distributions aren\u2019t taxed, provided the funds are spent on eligible expenses.<\/li><li>Some states also offer state-level tax advantages.<\/li><li>As the donor, you always maintain control of the funds. You can pull your money back out at any time. However, the earnings will be taxed. There is also an additional 10% tax penalty.<\/li><li>There are no income restrictions or age limits on the beneficiary of a 529 plan. If you\u2019re older and would like to go back to school, a 529 plan is an option.<\/li><li>You can choose a plan from any state, regardless of your residency. The funds can then be applied to any school, regardless of location.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><strong>Capital Losses. <\/strong>Sooner or later, you&#8217;re bound to have an investment that loses money. This loss can be subtracted from your capital gains, in most cases. If your losses are greater than your gains, you can deduct up to $3,000 from your other income, even your wages.<\/li><li><strong><em>A common strategy is to sell off your losses at the end of the tax year.<\/em><\/strong> You must be careful not to buy back the stock too quickly or the deduction will be nullified. You must wait more than 30 days. This is called the &#8220;wash sale&#8221; rule.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Just as there are multiple taxes to consider, there are also multiple strategies to combat them.<\/em><\/strong> For your best results, consult a <a href=\"https:\/\/blueocea.local\/sample-page\/contact-us\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"272\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tax professional<\/a> before developing and executing a tax \/ investment strategy. Don&#8217;t let the taxman take a bigger bite out of your bank account than absolutely necessary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be sure to utilize your retirement accounts as much as possible. You&#8217;ll be more than a little grateful later in life.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Taxes can take away a significant chunk of your investment income.
