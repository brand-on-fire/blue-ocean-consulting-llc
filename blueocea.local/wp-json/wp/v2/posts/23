Getting a handle your business taxes can increase your income and help you avoid legal issues.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">There are many types of streams of cash. Not all sources of cash are taxable.

The business is required to record how much you put in to the business. And the business may require multiple investments into it to keep it going until it is stable and making its own money. Likewise when you take money out of the business, it first draws down the amount you initially invested. If the business is making money and you have drawn past your initial investment then your draws may be come taxable\u2026This is an over simplification, as that is not technically how tax is figured regarding the business but it is to help you understand.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Sales &#8211; Money if for the sale of products or services minus expenses is taxable. There are some expenses that do not count as expenses, for instance, businesses that file on a Sch C within their personal 1040 tax return cannot take charitable deductions but businesses that file on any other tax form such as a 1041, 1120S, 1120, 1065 can all take donations as a deduction and are not limited to a certain percentage of income.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Loans \/ Debt &#8211; Specifically when a business takes out a loan and increases their liquid capital, the increase in cash is not a taxable event. And the interest that the business pays back to the lender for the privilege of using the loan is a tax deduction. The IRS doesn\u2019t classify most business loans as income. But the interest paid on loans is generally a deductible expense. <strong><em>It\u2019s important to have records regarding the use of any loans.<\/em><\/strong> It might be for equipment or to finance some other activity.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Investments interest &#8211; these come from the business when it owns stocks, bonds, mutual funds, has interest from money owed to them through loans that they have provided to others, or has capital gains from property or assets (not inventory) that they have sold.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">What Items of Cash Flow are Taxable?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":24,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v17.8 -
